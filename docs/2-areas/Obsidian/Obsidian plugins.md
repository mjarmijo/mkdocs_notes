Quick switcher is a core plugin that lets you search and open notes using only your keyboard.

There are several ways to open Quick Switcher, when it's enabled:

    Press Ctrl+O (or Cmd+O on macOS) to open the Quick switcher;
    In the ribbon, click Open Quick switcher ( lucide-file-search.svg > icon );
    On mobile, when you're not editing a note, tap the plus icon at bottom center of the app.

3. **Templater**
- Allows the creation of templates for your obsidian notes
- You can set up shortcuts (Like ctrl+I) to paste in a template
- set up defaults, so creating a new note in a folder gets a default template
