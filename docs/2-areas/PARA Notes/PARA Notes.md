Projects
-  Short term efforts; a collection of tasks and notes
-  Collect information about a task in a folder
- short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind. For example:
	- Complete webpage design
	- Buy a new computer
	- Write research report
	- Renovate the bathroom
	- Finish Spanish language course
	- Set up new living room furniture
Areas
-  Responsible for over a longer period of time - think house maintenance
-  Ongoing engagement or responsibility
- You have **areas** of responsibility – important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention. These might include:
	- Work responsibilities such as Marketing, Human Resources, Product Management, Research and Development, Direct Reports, or Engineering
	- Personal responsibilities such as Health, Finances, Kids, Writing, Car, or Home
Resources
- topics or interests which you expect to be useful in the future
- Reference notes, things you'll come back to later
- Go, Linux, vacation trips
- Then you have **resources** on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about, such as:
	- Graphic design
	- Personal productivity
	- Organic gardening
	- Coffee
	- Modern architecture
	- Web design
	- Japanese language
	- French literature
	- Notetaking
	- Breathwork
	- Habit formation
	- Photography
	- Marketing assets
Archive
- Inactive items which are not useful currently or in the near future, but you don't want to throw away
- Navigate the vault through search, so it can be included or excluded
- Finally, you have **archives**, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:
	- Projects you’ve completed or put on hold
	- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
	- Resources that you’re no longer interested in
