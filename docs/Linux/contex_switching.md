# Context Switching in Operating Systems: A Detailed Explanation

How does the kernel handle context switching efficiently.

## Scenario: Context Switch Between Task A and Task B

I walk through a context switch in a Linux system where the kernel switches from **Task A** to **Task B**

Focus:

- Kernal's role in managing context switches
- Isolation and security between tasks

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Key components:

Scheduler: what is the scheduler in linux?: The scheduler is an operating system component that determines which tasks run on the CPU and when the tasks run. It is responsible for managing the CPU’s time efficiently and fairly. The scheduler uses various algorithms to decide what is fair (i.e. which task to run next), based on factors like task priority, time slices (i.e. alloted time), and other scheduling policies.

Process control block: The Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to manage information about a process. It contains information such as the process ID, process state (i.e. stack pointer), the next instruction to execute (i.e. program counter), CPU registers, and other details needed to manage and control the process.

Program Counter: The program counter (PC) is a register in the CPU that stores the address of the next instruction to be executed. It is a key component in the context switch process, as it determines where the CPU should resume execution for a seamless transition. During a context switch, the Program counter is saved and restored to ensure that the task resumes execution correctly.

Stack pointer: The stack pointer (SP) is a register in the CPU that points to the top of the stack. The stack is used to store function calls, local variables, and return addresses. During a context switch, the stack pointer is saved and restored to ensure that the task resumes execution correctly.

#### 1. **Triggering the Context Switch**

- **When it happens**: A context switch is triggered when the operating system decides that the currently running task (Task A) has either used up its time slice, is waiting for some I/O operation, or is blocked for some other reason (e.g., waiting for a resource to become available). Switching also happen when a higher-priority task becomes ready to run or when an interrupt occurs (like a hardware interrupt from a device).

- **The Role of the Scheduler**: The kernel’s **scheduler** decides when a context switch happens. The scheduler’s role is to ensure fair distribution of CPU time among tasks and to respect their priority levels. It decides which task should run next based on factors like task priority, time slices, and other internal scheduling algorithms (e.g., round-robin, priority-based scheduling).

#### 2. **Saving Task A’s State**

- **Pausing Task A**: The kernel halts Task A’s execution when the scheduler decides to switch. The key here is to **preserve the task’s state** so that it can continue seamlessly from where it left off.

- **What gets saved**: The kernel saves the following state of Task A:
  - **CPU Registers**: These are small, fast, temporary storage areas used by the CPU to hold values that the task is currently working with (like data, intermediate calculations, pointers to memory, etc.). They are also known as processor registers or memory registers
    - Examples of CPU registers include the **program counter (PC)**, **stack pointer (SP)**, and general-purpose registers like **RAX**, **RBX**, **RCX**, etc.
    - The registers hold critical information about the task’s execution state
    - Saving and restoring these registers is essential for the task to resume correctly
  - Each task has its own set of registers, so when switching, the current set of registers needs to be saved to avoid overwriting the task's data.
  - **Program Counter (PC)**: The program counter stores the address of the next instruction that the CPU will execute. This allows the task to resume from the exact point it was interrupted.
  - **Stack Pointer (SP)**: The stack pointer tracks the task’s current position on its stack. The stack is used to store function calls, local variables, and return addresses. This ensures that when Task A resumes, its function calls and local variables are intact.
  - **Additional Context**: In some cases, the kernel may also save the task’s floating-point or vector registers if the task uses advanced CPU features like SIMD instructions (e.g., for mathematical computations).

- **Where the state is saved**: The saved context is typically stored in memory within **task_struct** (or **thread_info**) structures. These are kernel-managed data structures that represent each task. Each task has its own `task_struct`, which contains information like the saved CPU registers, process IDs, the task’s scheduling details, and more.

#### 3. **Choosing Task B to Run**

- **Scheduler’s Decision**: After saving Task A’s state, the scheduler selects the next task to run. In this case, it chooses **Task B**.
  - The decision could be based on Task B’s priority (if it’s a higher-priority task) or because Task B has become ready to run (for example, after waiting for some resource).
  - The **scheduler** uses **scheduling policies** to decide which task gets the CPU next, balancing fairness with efficiency. Common algorithms include **round-robin scheduling**, **priority-based scheduling**, and **multilevel feedback queues**.

- **Choosing the Next Task Efficiently**: The **scheduler** maintains a list (or queue) of ready tasks. It selects the next task based on priority and other factors, minimizing wasted CPU time. The kernel uses **preemptive multitasking**, meaning the scheduler can interrupt and switch tasks at any time (even within the middle of a task’s execution).

---

#### 4. **Restoring Task B’s State**

- **Loading Task B’s State**: The kernel now restores Task B’s state, allowing it to resume execution. This includes:
  - **Restoring CPU Registers**: The kernel loads the saved register values from Task B’s state into the CPU registers. These registers include temporary data (e.g., values for ongoing calculations or state tracking) that Task B was working with before being paused.
  - **Restoring Program Counter (PC)**: The program counter is updated to the saved address where Task B left off. This is crucial for ensuring that Task B resumes at the correct place in its execution flow, without skipping any instructions or repeating previous ones.
  - **Restoring Stack Pointer (SP)**: The kernel also updates the stack pointer to where Task B’s stack was when it was paused. This ensures that Task B’s function calls and local variables are restored correctly, and that it continues its execution on the correct stack frame.

- **Isolation**: Each task has its own **isolated memory space**. The kernel ensures that one task cannot interfere with the memory or state of another task. This isolation is fundamental for **security** and **stability**. It prevents tasks from accessing each other’s data, which could lead to data corruption or security vulnerabilities. In a **multitasking environment**, tasks should be isolated, and the kernel provides mechanisms like **virtual memory** and **memory protection** to achieve this.

- **Switching Between Tasks Securely**: To prevent malicious or poorly-behaved tasks from manipulating other tasks’ data, the kernel enforces strict memory protections and process boundaries. Virtual memory allows each task to believe it has its own private memory, even though multiple tasks may be running on the same physical machine.

---

#### 5. **Context Switch Completion**

- **Task B Resumes Execution**: After restoring Task B’s state, the kernel gives control of the CPU to Task B. Task B begins executing from the point where it left off, as if it had been running continuously.

- **Efficient Execution**: The kernel’s job is to ensure that the context switch itself is **minimal in overhead**. It strives to switch tasks as efficiently as possible, reducing the time spent switching tasks. Context switches need to be quick, or else the system would waste too much time switching between tasks instead of actually running them.

---

#### 6. **Task B Running and Returning to Task A**

- **Task B Runs**: Task B continues to run until one of the following happens:
  - It completes its execution.
  - It gets blocked (waiting for I/O or some other event).
  - It consumes its time slice, and the scheduler decides to switch to another task (possibly back to Task A).

- **Returning to Task A**: If Task A needs to be resumed, the kernel repeats the context switch process. Task A’s state is restored, and it begins executing from the point where it left off.

### Key Points in the Context Switch Process

1. **State Saving and Restoring**: The operating system saves the current state (CPU registers, program counter, stack pointer) of the running task and restores the saved state of the new task.
2. **Task Isolation and Security**: The kernel isolates each task’s memory and state to ensure security. Virtual memory and memory protection mechanisms prevent tasks from interfering with each other.
3. **Efficient Task Scheduling**: The kernel uses algorithms to efficiently decide which task to run next. The goal is to minimize the overhead of context switching, so the CPU spends more time running tasks and less time switching between them.
4. **Memory Management**: Each task operates in its own virtual address space, and the kernel manages memory so that one task cannot corrupt the memory of another task.
5. **Preemptive Multitasking**: The kernel uses preemptive multitasking, meaning the scheduler can interrupt a running task and switch to another at any point. This enables fair sharing of the CPU and ensures that tasks with higher priority or urgency get to run when needed.

### In Summary

A **context switch** is a fundamental mechanism that allows the kernel to efficiently manage multiple tasks running on a single CPU. The process involves saving the current task’s state, selecting the next task, and restoring its state so that it can continue running. This switch happens quickly and securely, with mechanisms in place to ensure that tasks are isolated from each other to prevent interference. The kernel ensures that context switches are done efficiently to minimize the overhead and ensure the system can run many tasks simultaneously.
