## Summary

**Encapsulation** - The process of wrapping methods and attributes (i.e. data and functions) in a unit (i.e. class). Access is allowed only through special syntax. Encapsulation hides details of the object and exposes a well defined set of functionality to the user. Example: A car encapsulates a lot of complex components (engine, battery, drive-train) that you don't need to understand in order to drive.
