Guide to type checking in Python

Type hints in python help you to define what what objects should be (string, dict, list) and allow you to use tools that check your code to make sure it is consistent when it runs. 

**In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the following:**

- Type annotations and type hints
- Adding static types to code, both your code and the code of others
- Running a static type checker
- Enforcing types at runtime
