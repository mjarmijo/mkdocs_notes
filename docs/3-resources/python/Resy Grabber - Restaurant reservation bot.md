[[resy reservations]]

This is an open-source tool to help manage restaurant reservations on Resy.com. It was previously a SaaS product but has been converted to a locally runnable application with no authentication required. This is the first SAAS product that I've released and it was very fun to work on! I am open sourcing this now though because New York passed laws making it illegal to sell dinner reservations.

- I tested this bot, but it was failing due to some proxy issue even though it is supposed to be "optional"
- Tasks did not work as expected
- Easy enough to use
