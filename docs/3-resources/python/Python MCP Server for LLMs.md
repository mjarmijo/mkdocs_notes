Make an MCP Server to build tools for AI agents

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new open protocol that allows AI models to interact with external systems in a standardized, extensible way. In this tutorial, you’ll install MCP, explore its client-server architecture, and work with its core concepts: prompts, resources, and tools. You’ll then build and test a Python MCP server that queries e-commerce data and integrate it with an AI agent in Cursor to see real tool calls in action.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand:

    What MCP is and why it was created
    What MCP prompts, resources, and tools are
    How to build an MCP server with customized tools
    How to integrate your MCP server with AI agents like Cursor

You’ll get hands-on experience with Python MCP by creating and testing MCP servers and connecting your MCP to AI tools. To keep the focus on learning MCP rather than building a complex project, you’ll build a simple MCP server that interacts with a simulated e-commerce database. You’ll also use Cursor’s MCP client, which saves you from having to implement your own.
